# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Michael Tanjuakio**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**MetricCalculator** is an android app that is able to convert distance to distance in the metric system.
For example: 1 kilometers converts to 1000 meters

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üìèüìêüõ´**

## Notes

Making this app was pretty fun. I realize the stretch goals are the real core of the assignment
I found that I spent a considerable more time learning the stretch goals. I needed to learn
ViewBinding, and Codepath provided great documentation to implement this.
I learned more about buttons, listeners, and views much more with this project!
